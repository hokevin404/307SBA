                            Son Goku is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the Dragon Ball manga series 
                            created by Akira Toriyama. He is based on Sun Wukong (known as Son Goku in Japan and Monkey King 
                            in the West), a main character of the classic 16th-century Chinese novel Journey to the West, 
                            combined with influences from the Hong Kong action cinema of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee. Goku made 
                            his debut in the first Dragon Ball chapter, Bulma and Son Goku, originally published 
                            in Japan's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on December 3, 1984. Goku is introduced as an eccentric, 
                            monkey-tailed boy who practices martial arts and possesses superhuman strength. He meets Bulma and 
                            joins her on a journey to find the seven wish-granting Dragon Balls. Along the way, he finds new 
                            friends who follow him on his journey to become stronger. As Goku grows up, he becomes the Earth's 
                            mightiest warrior and battles a wide variety of villains with the help of his friends and family, 
                            while also gaining new allies in the process.

                            Vegeta, fully referred to as Prince Vegeta IV, is a fictional character in the Japanese franchise 
                            Dragon Ball created by Akira Toriyama. Vegeta made his appearance in chapter #204 "Sayonara, Son 
                            Goku", published in Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on January 7, 1989, seeking the wish-granting 
                            Dragon Balls to achieve immortality.

                            As the first major antagonist of Dragon Ball Z, Vegeta is the prince of an elite extraterrestrial 
                            warrior race known as the Saiyans. As a person, he is naturally blunt, regal, and hard-working; 
                            he often refers to his heritage and royal status throughout the series, but can also have negative 
                            traits such as being extremely haughty along with a destructive temper. He believed that he 
                            should be regarded as the strongest fighter in the universe, and becomes obsessed with surpassing 
                            Son Goku. Throughout the series, Vegeta's role changes from villain to later as one of the heroes, 
                            while remaining a key rival to Goku.

                            Frieza is a fictional character and the primary antagonist in the Dragon Ball manga series 
                            created by Akira Toriyama. He makes his debut in Chapter #247: "Dark Clouds Swirl Over Planet 
                            Namek", first published in Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on October 24, 1989, as the main 
                            antagonist of his eponymous saga, depicted as a galactic tyrant feared as the most powerful 
                            being in the universe.

                            Despite not appearing until the manga's second half, Frieza is widely considered to be the most 
                            iconic and popular villain in Dragon Ball, and the archenemy of Goku - since he effectively 
                            serves as the catalyst of many of the events depicted in the story, due to the destruction of the 
                            Saiyan homeworld Planet Vegeta at his hands and Goku's arrival on Earth and subsequent conflicts 
                            with Raditz, Nappa and Vegeta. Frieza later appears as the primary villain in the 2015 film Dragon 
                            Ball Z: Resurrection 'F' and as a recurring character in Dragon Ball Super.

                            Beerus, the God of Destruction, is a fictional character from the Dragon Ball franchise created 
                            by Akira Toriyama. Beerus made his debut appearance in the 2013 film Dragon Ball Z: Battle of 
                            Gods as the antagonist and returned as a supporting character in Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F', 
                            as well as one of the main characters in Dragon Ball Super. He is a deity known as a God of 
                            Destruction and resembles a purple cat wearing traditional Egyptian clothing and ornaments, whose 
                            occupation is to maintain balance in the universe by destroying, in contrast to the Supreme Kais 
                            who create and preserve.

                            It has been stated that Beerus is capable of destroying entire universes by Whis. Often seen 
                            destroying planets at a whim, Beerus' two sole desires are, being quite a gourmet, enjoying food 
                            he likes to eat and fighting opponents whom he considers as worthy. The latter ultimately leads 
                            him to look for the Super Saiyan God, which turns out to be one of the Saiyans now living on Earth. 
                            Eventually, Goku, with the help of the other Saiyans, transforms into the Super Saiyan God and 
                            fights Beerus, just to be defeated by the God of Destruction. Having enjoyed the match, Beerus 
                            spares both Goku and the Earth, saying that Goku was the second strongest opponent he ever faced; 
                            the first being his caretaker and martial arts teacher, Whis.

                            Whis is an angelic being who appears in the fourteenth and fifteenth Dragon Ball Z films, as well 
                            as in Dragon Ball Super. A tall teal humanoid with pronounced effeminate features, he is an Angel, 
                            a being of extremely high status within the multiverse hierarchy. Each Angel is bound to the 
                            service of a God of Destruction of their respective universes as personal attendants and guides, 
                            rarely leaving them unaccompanied: they are tasked with supervising their deity, and may intervene 
                            to keep them in check. Whis is consistently depicted as unmatched in power and possesses tremendous 
                            speed, effortlessly defending himself against assailants. It is also revealed that he and his fellow 
                            angels possess the autonomous martial arts ability of reacting to attacks without the interference of 
                            the mind, Ultra Instinct, a technique notorious for its difficulty to master even among deities, which 
                            is foreshadowed during his training of Goku and Vegeta, then later unexpectedly, but briefly achieved 
                            by Goku in the Tournament of Power.

                            The character's name stems from a misunderstanding; Toriyama incorrectly believed that Beerus's name 
                            was a pun on the word "beer" and so decided to follow the same rule to name the character's assistant, 
                            naming the character Whis as a pun on "whisky".
