                            Son Goku is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the Dragon Ball manga series 
                            created by Akira Toriyama. He is based on Sun Wukong (known as Son Goku in Japan and Monkey King 
                            in the West), a main character of the classic 16th-century Chinese novel Journey to the West, 
                            combined with influences from the Hong Kong action cinema of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee. Goku made 
                            his debut in the first Dragon Ball chapter, Bulma and Son Goku, originally published 
                            in Japan's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on December 3, 1984. Goku is introduced as an eccentric, 
                            monkey-tailed boy who practices martial arts and possesses superhuman strength. He meets Bulma and 
                            joins her on a journey to find the seven wish-granting Dragon Balls. Along the way, he finds new 
                            friends who follow him on his journey to become stronger. As Goku grows up, he becomes the Earth's 
                            mightiest warrior and battles a wide variety of villains with the help of his friends and family, 
                            while also gaining new allies in the process.

                            Vegeta, fully referred to as Prince Vegeta IV, is a fictional character in the Japanese franchise 
                            Dragon Ball created by Akira Toriyama. Vegeta made his appearance in chapter #204 "Sayonara, Son 
                            Goku", published in Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on January 7, 1989, seeking the wish-granting 
                            Dragon Balls to achieve immortality.

                            As the first major antagonist of Dragon Ball Z, Vegeta is the prince of an elite extraterrestrial 
                            warrior race known as the Saiyans. As a person, he is naturally blunt, regal, and hard-working; 
                            he often refers to his heritage and royal status throughout the series, but can also have negative 
                            traits such as being extremely haughty along with a destructive temper. He believed that he 
                            should be regarded as the strongest fighter in the universe, and becomes obsessed with surpassing 
                            Son Goku. Throughout the series, Vegeta's role changes from villain to later as one of the heroes, 
                            while remaining a key rival to Goku.
